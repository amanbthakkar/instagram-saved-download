A telegram bot to download the last few pictures I have marked as saved

## What you need to know beforehand
1. What selenium is and how does it work
2. How to create a bot using 'BotFather' on Telegram and how to create commands using BotFather


## Caveats of current version
1. Not deployed anywhere online. That means I have to run the code locally and it works as long as I keep it running. 
Since there it involves uploading the chromedriver as well as the code, I need to do some research to see how to do it.
2. No attention paid to code structure, only functionality :stuck_out_tongue:
3. Does not work if the post is a video, but that part is very easy to add once you get how this works.
